# EventShop Nepal: Comprehensive Project Report

## Project Introduction
EventShop Nepal is a comprehensive web-based e-commerce platform designed to revolutionize the way individuals and event planners procure supplies for celebrations in Nepal. In the vibrant cultural landscape of cities like Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur, events such as weddings, Pasnis (rice-feeding ceremonies), Bratabandhas, birthdays, and corporate gatherings are not merely social obligations but deeply rooted traditions that require meticulous planning and specific materials. Traditionally, sourcing these materials—ranging from specific decorative items, helium balloons, and lighting to traditional ceremonial requisites—has been a fragmented and physically exhausting process. Customers often find themselves visiting multiple physical marketplaces, such as Asan, Indrachowk, or scattered retail outlets in New Road, to find high-quality products at reasonable prices. This traditional method is fraught with challenges, including lack of price transparency, limited stock visibility, traffic congestion, and the sheer time consumption involved in physical procurement. EventShop Nepal addresses these multifaceted issues by providing a centralized, user-friendly digital marketplace where customers can browse an extensive catalog of event supplies, view detailed product specifications, compare prices, and make secure purchases from the comfort of their homes or offices.

The platform is more than just an online store; it is a specialized ecosystem tailored to the unique needs of the Nepalese event industry. Unlike generic e-commerce platforms that offer a broad range of consumer goods but lack depth in specific categories, EventShop Nepal focuses exclusively on event essentials. This specialization allows for features that are specifically meaningful to this domain, such as bulk ordering for large parties, categorized browsing by event type (e.g., "Wedding Essentials," "Birthday Bash"), and curated packages that bundle necessary items for specific occasions. For the consumers, this means a significant reduction in the cognitive load and physical effort required to organize an event. Instead of keeping mental checklists and making multiple trips to different vendors, they can find everything under one digital roof, ensuring consistency in the theme and quality of their supplies. The system supports various payment methods suitable for the local context, including Digital Wallets like eSewa and Khalti, as well as Cash on Delivery, ensuring accessibility for a wide demographic of users ranging from tech-savvy youths to more traditional families transitioning to digital services.

Furthermore, EventShop Nepal provides significant value to the supply side of the equation. For local vendors, artisans, and small business owners who deal in event supplies, the platform offers a streamlined avenue to reach a broader audience beyond their immediate geographical vicinity. Many traditional shops in the Kathmandu Valley face limitations in terms of physical visibility and marketing reach. By listing their products on EventShop Nepal, they can showcase their inventory to thousands of potential customers, manage their stock more efficiently through digital tools, and receive direct orders without the need for an elaborate physical storefront in a prime location. The system’s administrative dashboard provides these stakeholders (managed centrally in this iteration) with insights into popular products, stock levels, and revenue trends, fostering a more data-driven approach to business that is often missing in the unorganized retail sector. Overall, EventShop Nepal fosters a symbiotic ecosystem that enhances efficiency, transparency, and satisfaction for both buyers and sellers, modernizing a traditional industry while respecting its cultural importance.

## Background of the System
The genesis of EventShop Nepal lies in the observation of the growing disparity between the rapid life of modern urban Nepal and the archaic methods available for event management and procurement. The Kathmandu Valley, known as the "City of Temples" and festivals, hosts an extraordinary number of social and cultural events year-round. From the grandeur of the wedding season, where thousands of ceremonies take place simultaneously, to the intimacy of family gatherings like birthdays and anniversaries, the demand for event supplies is perennial and substantial. However, the infrastructure supporting this demand has historically been informal and disorganized. The "Old Market" system, while culturally rich, is operationally inefficient for the modern consumer. A typical family planning a Bratabandha might need to visit a fabric store for decorations, a stationery shop for invitations, a wholesale market for disposables, and a specialty store for ceremonial items. This fragmentation leads to a chaotic purchasing experience characterized by bargaining, uncertainty about product availability, and the physical strain of navigating crowded, pollution-heavy streets.

Despite the penetration of internet services and the ubiquity of smartphones—with Nepal boasting high mobile connection rates—the specialized niche of event supplies has remained largely untouched by the digital revolution that has transformed sectors like food delivery (e.g., Pathao Food, Foodmandu) or general retail (e.g., Daraz). While general-purpose e-commerce sites exist, they often lack the curation and specific inventory depth required for event planning. A user searching for "Anniversary Decoration Set" on a general platform might find scattered listings with little cohesion, unsure if the balloons match the banners or if the candles are of the right type. There is a "trust gap" and a "convenience gap" that EventShop Nepal aims to bridge. The background context is further complicated by the changing demographics of the valley; a younger, working-class generation is increasingly responsible for planning family events but has less time to dedicate to the traditional market runs. They value time, transparency, and reliability over the potential small savings of haggling in a physical market.

Moreover, the existing digital attempts by individual vendors are often limited to social media pages (Facebook, Instagram) which, while popular, lack the structure of a formal booking or purchasing system. Transactions on these platforms are manual, relying on direct messaging, manual bank transfers, and unverified availability assertions. This "conversational commerce" is prone to miscommunication, delayed responses, and a lack of accountability. If a vendor forgets a message, an order is missed. EventShop Nepal professionalizes this space by introducing a structured database, real-time inventory management, and automated order processing flows. It moves the industry from a disorganized, ad-hoc state to a systematized, reliable digital economy. The system acknowledges the high stakes of event planning—where a missing item can disrupt a ceremony—and builds its logic around reliability and clarity. By integrating inventory tracking, the system ensures that if a user books 50 gold balloons, those balloons are actually reserved, eliminating the "out of stock" surprises common in less sophisticated systems.

## Literature Review
The shift towards vertical e-commerce—platforms dedicated to specific niches rather than selling everything—is a well-documented global trend. Literature in digital commerce suggests that as markets mature, consumers prefer specialized platforms that offer deeper expertise and better user experiences for specific categories over generic "one-size-fits-all" marketplaces. In the context of event management, global giants like Party City (USA) or specialized Etsy sellers have demonstrated the immense potential of focusing on the "celebration economy." These platforms succeed not just by selling products, but by selling "solutions"—curated themes, ideas, and organized categories that help the user visualize their event. Research into consumer behavior indicates that when planning emotionally significant events, users exhibit high involvement and high anxiety; they seek platforms that reduce risk through social proof (reviews), detailed visual information (high-quality images using things like magnifiers), and guaranteed logistics.

In the Nepalese context, the literature on digital adoption reveals a unique trajectory. The adoption of digital wallets (eSewa, Khalti, IME Pay) has been a primary driver of e-commerce growth, leaping over credit card adoption. Studies on "Digital Nepal" initiatives highlight that while urban youth are digital natives, there is a substantial "digital immigrant" population that is learning to trust online systems. Therefore, successful local platforms are those that bridge this gap—offering advanced tech features (like filters and search) but wrapping them in a familiar, user-friendly interface that feels approachable. The failure of some past e-commerce ventures in Nepal is often attributed to poor logistics, lack of trust in payment, and complex user interfaces. EventShop Nepal’s design draws from these lessons, emphasizing a "clean" UI, straightforward navigation (Home -> Product -> Cart -> Checkout), and the integration of trusted local payment gateways to build immediate credibility.

Comparative analysis with existing local solutions reveals significant gaps. General marketplaces like Hamrobazar are classifieds-based; they connect buyers and sellers but do not facilitate the transaction or guarantee the product, leading to high friction. Daraz offers a managed marketplace model but suffers from a cluttered interface where cheap, low-quality items often drown out quality event supplies, and delivery times can be unpredictable. Social media sellers (Instagram stores) offer curation but lack scalability and transactional security. EventShop Nepal positions itself at the intersection of these models: it offers the structure and security of a managed marketplace like Daraz, the curation and aesthetic appeal of an Instagram store, and the ease of payment of a modern digital wallet app. This "best of all worlds" approach is the theoretical underpinning of the system’s design, aiming to maximize user acceptance by addressing the specific deficiencies of current alternatives.

## PACT Analysis

### People
The primary users of EventShop Nepal are divided into distinct personas. **The "Busy Planner"** is a working professional, aged 25-40, residing in the Kathmandu Valley. They are tech-savvy, value time over money, and are often tasked with organizing office parties or family gatherings. They need quick search, reliable delivery, and mobile accessibility. **The "Traditional Host"** is an older user, perhaps a parent, who is less comfortable with technology but needs to source supplies for a religious ceremony. For them, the system must be incredibly simple, with large text, clear images, and intuitive "Add to Cart" flows. **The Administrator** is the backend power user, responsible for maintaining the catalog, verifying inventory, and managing orders. They require a data-dense interface (Dashboards) to oversee operations efficiently. The system is designed to be inclusive, ensuring that whilst the backend functionality is robust, the frontend remains accessible to users with varying levels of digital literacy.

### Activities
The core activities supported by the system form a linear, logical flow. **Discovery**: Users engage in browsing categories (e.g., "Decorations," "Disposables") or using the search bar to find specific items. This activity is supported by filtering (by price, category) to narrow down choices. **Evaluation**: Users view product details, inspect high-quality images using zoom functionality, read descriptions, and check prices. **Acquisition**: The "Add to Cart" and "Checkout" activities are critical. The system must handle session persistence (keeping items in the cart if the user leaves) and secure data entry for shipping addresses. **Transaction**: The payment activity involves redirecting to secure gateways or confirming Cash on Delivery. **Management**: For admins, activities include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, updating order statuses (Pending -> Shipped -> Delivered), and viewing user analytics.

### Context
The physical and social context of usage is the bustling urban environment of Nepal. Users are likely accessing the site from mobile devices (smartphones) while on the go—perhaps during a commute or a lunch break—or from home during the evenings. The network conditions may vary from high-speed fiber Wi-Fi to spotty 4G mobile data, requiring the application to be lightweight and performant. The social context is one of "high stakes"—a delayed birthday banner is useless after the birthday. Therefore, the system operates in a context where reliability and timeliness are paramount. Economically, the users are price-sensitive but quality-conscious; they want value for money. The system’s design (showing discounts, original prices vs. sale prices) acknowledges this bargaining culture by presenting value propositions clearly.

### Technology
The technological backbone of EventShop Nepal is the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), chosen for its isomorphic nature (JavaScript across the stack) and scalability. **MongoDB** acts as the NoSQL database, ideal for storing unstructured product data where attributes might vary (e.g., a balloon has "color" and "material," while a candle has "burn time" and "scent"). **Express.js** and **Node.js** form the efficient, event-driven backend capable of handling multiple concurrent requests—crucial during peak wedding seasons when traffic spikes. **React.js** on the frontend ensures a Single Page Application (SPA) experience, meaning pages load instantly without refreshing, providing a smooth "app-like" feel that modern users expect. Authentication is handled via **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, ensuring stateless, secure user sessions. The system integrates closely with local APIs or SDKs for payments and uses responsive CSS frameworks to ensure perfect rendering across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Requirement Analysis Requirements describe the necessary functions and constraints of the system. A detailed analysis was conducted to understand what features were non-negotiable for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

A qualitative study of potential users revealed deep frustration with the "running around" aspect of event planning. Users described the "anxiety of forgetting something" as a major pain point. This led to the requirement for a centralized "Cart" that acts as a staging area, allowing users to build their order over time. Another strong signal was the need for visual clarity; users essentially "eat with their eyes" when buying decor. This mandated high-resolution image support and zoom capabilities. Trust was another major factor; users were wary of paying online for goods they hadn't seen. This validated the requirement for a robust "Cash on Delivery" option alongside digital payments, as well as a transparent "Order History" section where they can track the status of their purchase.

**Functional Requirements:**
1.  **User Authentication**: Users must be able to register and login securely. The system should support persistent sessions so users don't have to login every time they open the tab. Password security via hashing (bcrypt) is mandatory.
2.  **Product Catalog & Search**: The system must display products in a grid layout. A search bar is required that queries the database for product names. Filters for category and price range are necessary to help users navigate large inventories.
3.  **Product Details**: Clicking a product must lead to a dedicated page showing stock status, detailed description, price, and related products to encourage upsell.
4.  **Shopping Cart Management**: Users must be able to add items, remove items, and adjust quantities in real-time. The cart total must calculate automatically.
5.  **Checkout & Order Placement**: A multi-step form to collect shipping information (Address, City, Phone) is required. The system must create an 'Order' record in the database upon completion.
6.  **Admin Dashboard**: A restricted area for admins to view all users, manage product listings (add/edit images, prices), and change order statuses.
7.  **Reviews and Ratings**: Authenticated users should be able to leave star ratings and text reviews for products they have purchased.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
1.  **Performance**: The landing page should load in under 2 seconds on a standard 4G connection. API response times should be under 200ms for standard queries.
2.  **Scalability**: The database architecture must support thousands of products and user records without performance degradation.
3.  **Security**: All data in transit must be encrypted via SSL (HTTPS). User passwords must never be stored in plain text. API endpoints must be protected against common attacks like SQL Injection (handled by Mongoose sanitization) and XSS.
4.  **Usability**: The interface must be intuitive, requiring no training for a standard user to complete a purchase. It must be mobile-responsive, adapting layout (hamburger menus, stacked grids) for smaller screens.
5.  **Reliability**: The system should aim for 99.9% uptime during business hours. Error messages should be user-friendly (e.g., "Out of Stock" instead of "Error 500").

## Low-Fidelity Prototyping
Low-fidelity prototyping was the initial step in the design process, focusing on layout and flow rather than aesthetics. We utilized hand-drawn sketches and simple wireframing tools to map out the user journey. The initial concept for the "Home Page" was cluttered, attempting to show too much. Through low-fi iterations, we simplified this to a strong "Hero Section" followed by "Featured Products." We tested the "Checkout Flow" using paper prototypes—asking test subjects to "buy a balloon." This revealed that asking for the address *before* showing the cart total was confusing. We rearranged the flow to: Cart Review -> Shipping Address -> Payment Method -> Confirmation.

**Wizard of Oz Testing**: To validate the "Search" feature before building the complex backend search logic, we used a Wizard of Oz approach. We presented users with a search bar on a static screen. When they typed "Candles," a designer manually swapped the screen to a pre-drawn page of candles. This helped us understand what users *actually* search for. Do they search for "Birthday Candle" or just "Candle"? We found that specific queries were common, leading us to realize our database taxonomy needed to be detailed (keywords matter). This low-cost testing saved hours of development time by fixing the navigation hierarchy before a single line of code was written. We also tested the "Admin Panel" flow, ensuring that the "Add Product" form followed a logical sequence (Name -> Price -> Image) that matched the admin's mental model.

## Improvement on High Fidelity
Transitioning to high-fidelity prototypes involved bringing the design to life with color, typography, and interaction fidelity. The defined color palette—likely celebratory yet professional—was applied. However, the initial high-fidelity mockups highlighted several issues that needed refinement for the final product.
1.  **Visual Hierarchy**: The price text was initially too small. We increased the font weight and size for prices to make them the most scanning-friendly element on the card.
2.  **Button States**: The "Add to Cart" button didn't give enough feedback. We improved this by designing "Loading," "Success," and "Disabled" states. When a user adds an item, the button now briefly transforms or a "Toast" notification appears, confirming the action.
3.  **Navigation Consistency**: We noticed the "Footer" was inconsistent across pages in the prototype. We standardized the footer to always contain quick links, contact info, and copyright data, ensuring users never feel "trapped" at the bottom of a page.
4.  **Image Optimization**: The prototype used massive image files which looked great but would kill load times. The improvement plan included implementing image compression and a zoom lens feature that only loads the high-res version when needed.
5.  **Form Validation**: The high-fi prototype showed static forms. We designed dynamic error states—red borders for invalid emails, helper text for password requirements—to guide the user in real-time.
6.  **Owner Dashboard Data**: The admin charts were initially generic placeholders. We improved the design to show relevant metrics: "Top Selling Items" and "Low Stock Alerts," actionable data that actually helps the business owner.

## User Flow Diagram
*Note: While the diagram is visual, the narrative flow is described here.*
The user flow begins at the **Landing Page**. Here, the user has two paths: **Search/Browse** or **Login**. If they browse, they proceed to the **Product Detail Page**. From there, they can **Add to Cart**. If they are not logged in, attempting to **Checkout** triggers the **Login/Register Modal**. Once authenticated, they proceed to **Shipping Address Entry**. Next is **Order Summary & Payment Selection** (e.Sewa/Khalti/COD). Finally, the **Order Confirmation** page is displayed. A parallel flow exists for the **Admin**, who logs in and is routed to the **Dashboard**, bypassing the shopping flow to access **Product Management** and **Order Management** interfaces. This clear separation of concerns ensures security and purpose-driven navigation.

## High-Fidelity Prototyping
High-fidelity prototyping in the later stages simulated the actual application experience. We used tools to create clickable mockups where the "hover effects" worked, and the "dropdowns" dropped down. This stage was crucial for testing the emotional impact of the design. Does the site feel "fun"? Does it feel "trustworthy"?
**Guerrilla Testing**: We took these high-fidelity prototypes to coffee shops in Kathmandu. We asked random strangers to "Find a gift for a friend" using the prototype on our phone. This revealed real-world issues: like thumb-reachability on mobile screens. Users struggled to hit a "Back" button at the top-left corner on large phones. As a result, we improved the mobile navigation bar to be bottom-aligned or sticky, improving accessibility. We also tested the "Payment" screen to see if the "eSewa" logo was recognizable and instilled trust. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive for familiar icons, confirming our choice to highlight local payment partners visually.

## Improvement for the Final Product
The developed system is robust, but software is never "finished." Several improvements are identified for future iterations to make EventShop Nepal a world-class platform.
1.  **AI Recommendations**: Currently, related products are static. The future version should use Machine Learning (Collaborative Filtering) to suggest "Users who bought Birthday Candles also bought Party Poppers," increasing average order value.
2.  **Performance Tuning**: Implementing "Lazy Loading" for images and "Code Splitting" for the React bundle will further reduce the initial load time, crucial for users on slower mobile data connections.
3.  **Advanced Search**: Implementing fuzzy search (handling typos like "ballon" instead of "balloon") using a specialized search engine like ElasticSearch would vastly improve usability.
4.  **Real-Time Logistics Tracking**: Integrating with a courier API (like Pathao or Nepal Can Move) to show real-time delivery status on the map would be a game-changer for transparency.
5.  **Vendor Portal**: Moving from a single-admin system to a multi-vendor marketplace where independent sellers can manage their own shops within EventShop would scale the inventory exponentially.
6.  **Security Hardening**: Introducing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for admin accounts and regular automated security audits to protect user data.

## Nielsen’s Heuristic Principle
The design of EventShop Nepal strictly adheres to Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics to ensure a superior user experience.
1.  **Visibility of System Status**: The system always informs the user of what is happening (e.g., spinners when loading, toast messages when adding to cart).
2.  **Match Between System and Real World**: We use language familiar to the user (e.g., "Cart" instead of "Order Buffer," "Checkout" instead of "Process Transaction").
3.  **User Control and Freedom**: Users have full control over multimedia elements; for instance, the "How to Shop" video in the footer opens in a modal that can be easily closed via an 'X' button or by clicking the overlay, ensuring they never feel trapped by content. "Emergency Exits" like the Home logo are always available for navigation reset.
4.  **Consistency and Standards**: The site follows standard e-commerce patterns (Cart in top right, Logo in top left). Buttons for similar actions (Buy, Confirm) look the same across pages.
5.  **Error Prevention**: We prevent errors by disabling the "Place Order" button until the form is valid, rather than letting the user fail and getting an error message.
6.  **Recognition Rather Than Recall**: We show the cart contents in a mini-sidebar so the user doesn't have to remember what they added.
7.  **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**: While simple for new users, power users can use shortcuts (like clicking on category tags) to navigate faster.
8.  **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: The interface is not cluttered. Every element on the product card (Image, Price, Name) serves a purpose; unnecessary metadata is hidden.
9.  **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**: If a login fails, the message says "Incorrect Password" (or similar clear text), not "Error 403," helping the user fix the issue.
10. **Help and Documentation**: A comprehensive support system is integrated directly into the footer, featuring a "How to Shop" video guide that visually demonstrates the purchasing process for less tech-savvy users, ensuring assistance is always just one click away.
